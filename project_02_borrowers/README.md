# Research of the reliability of borrowers
Customer - Bank credit department. It is necessary to figure out whether the marital status and the number of clients' children affect the fact of repaying the loan on time. The input data from the bank - statistics of customers` payments.

The results of the study will be taken into account to build a credit scoring model - a special system that evaluates the ability of a potential borrower to return a loan to the bank.
## Purpose of research:
Make an analysis the statistics of the customers` payment of the bank credit department.
## Research result:
**Several hypotheses are checked and concluded:**

 * The number of children affects the payment of a loan on time, so childless borrowers often repay the loan on time.

 * Family status also affects the payment of a loan on time: unmarried more often delay the loan payments, widower and widows - less often.

 * Based on the data the level of income - there are no special differences between categories of low and higher than average, but with high incomes clients less often are not paid on time.

 * If we consider the purpose of issuing a loan - for operations with cars and education - more often are not paid on time.
